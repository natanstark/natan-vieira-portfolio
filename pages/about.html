            <div class="about__text">

                <p>Since childhood, I have been fascinated by technology. Motivated by the curiosity to understand how things work, I developed my first Java application when 
                    I was only 12 years old. At the age of 16, I created an Android app as a school project. Over the years, I became increasingly interested in graphic design, 
                    working on various projects as a freelancer.</p>

                <p>Nowadays, I develop engaging and responsive web applications using key technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, and React. I'm a Front-end Developer; 
                    however, I also possess knowledge and experience in Back-end technologies such as Java, NoSQL, SQL, and REST APIs. Additionally, I work as a UX/UI Designer. 
                    Creating graphic interfaces and developing quality user experiences has become a natural path for me, due my background in graphic design.</p>

                <p>What excites me most about being a Front-end Developer and UX/UI Designer is solving real-world problems. Developing and creating things, often from scratch, that 
                    help people solve a problem in a smooth and aesthetically pleasing way is something that is truly special. I can say that I love my work.</p>
    
                    <p>One of my favorite quotes is:</p>

                    <p id="quote-text">“Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” - Steve Jobs</p>
        
                        <p>As someone who has always been curious about how things function, this quote resonates deeply with me. I love creating things that are not only beautiful 
                            but also functional. After all, what's good in functionless beauty?</p>
